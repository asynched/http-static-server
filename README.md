# HTTP STATIC SERVER

A NodeJS server for serving static files within the file system. 📁

## Requirements 📖

1. Node >= 14
2. Yarn

## How to run

Install the dependencies with:

```sh
$ yarn
```

### Development 💻

To start the server, just run the following command:

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

### Production

> Do not run this in production though, lol. This is mainly for development, since it'll give access to any file within your file system. 🛑
